A simple unit in #Describe is the definition, also called an item or a termin. It consists of some literal text and a tag.




A definition contains a literal text, id tag, and possibly more
A definition is called an item or a termin
A production is called a branch
A single describe file is called a scripture
All connected branches, that might span multiple scriptures are called a tree or a subtree (tree of human nutrition - e.g.)


#Describe Id system
Every item in a #Describe tree must have an unique id. But how big an id needs to be?



Start at production marked with root attribute.
If there isn't, start with the one that appears first and build the largest possible tree
