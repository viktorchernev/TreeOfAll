DESCRIBE LANGUAGE SPECIFICATION VERSION 1



1. COMMENTS
There are two types of comments - single line comments and multi-line comments.
Single line comments start with double forward slashes ("//") and end with new line ("\n" or "\r\n" ).
Multi-line comments start with a froward slash and a star ("/*") and end with a star and a forward slash ("*/").
Comments cannot be nested. Comments in Describe are like comments in C++ or C#


2. WHITESPACES
Leading and trailing whitespaces are ignored, while inside statements they act as delimiter, although
their count and type is ignored - that is " " equals "    " equals "\t". 
New lines count is also ignored - "\n" equals "\n\n\n".


3. TERMINS
The describe markup language is all about different pieces of information that are arranged in lists.
Those pieces of information are called ITEMs or TERMINs (both are synonimous).
A TERMIN consists of some LITERAL and an ITEMTAG, and optionaly a LINK HEAP.
The LITERAL is self explanatory - an empty item is meaningless. 
The ITEMTAG provides the unique ID for the item.

	3-1. ITEMTAG
	An ITEMTAG is enclosed in angle brackets.
	ITEMTAGS consist of an ID.
	An example of an ITEMTAG would be "<IkwP2Saz>" or "<C>"
	An ITEMTAG is "<", 0 or more whitespaces, ID, 0 or more whitespaces, ">".

		3-1-1. ID
		The ID is a random string of alphanumeric characters with a given lenght, and is the unique identifier for the item.
		There should not be any 2 identical IDs.
		An ID looks like this - "IkwP2Saz".

	3-2. LINK HEAP
	The LINK HEAP is enclosed in square brackets.
	A LINK HEAP consists of one or more LINKS, separated by a comma ",".
	For example - "[www.some-url.com/article.htm | Some Url - Article, www.x.com/tod.htm | X Today]"

		3-2-1. LINK
		A LINK might be as simple as a valid URL - "www.some-url.com/article.htm"
		Or it might contain a title, in which case the title is separated by the URL by space and a pipe.
		Very much like the links in MediaWiki markup. For example - "www.some-url.com/article.htm | Some Url - Article",
		where "Some Url - Article" is the title.

	3-3. LITERAL
	Anything in a TERMIN that is not enclosed in angle or square brackets is a literal.
	It consists of various symbols, but cannot contain: 
	Some brackets - "<", ">", "[", "]";
	Or control characters - "->", ";", ",";
	All of those can be escaped though.
	
		3-3-1. ESCAPE SEQUENCE
		An ESCAPE SEQUENCE consists of a backslash and a command character.
		Escape sequences are: "\<", "\>", "\[", "\]", "\->", "\;", and "\,";


4. STATEMENTS
STATEMENTS, also called PRODUCTIONS represent a list in Describe.
A STATEMENT is a TERMIN, a production sign "->", one or more TERMINS delimited by a comma ",", semicolon ";".
For example, a valid STATEMENT is this (minus the quotation symbols) :

	"
	books <U8Tb5AoS> ->

		fantasy <y6Qj3HDE>,
		programming <udMnuUyE>,
		sociology <jeylSCAn>,
		cooking <tkJTvl1W>;
	"

An empty PRODUCTION is also syntactically valid, but is ignored (minus the quotation symbols):

	"
	books <U8Tb5AoS> ->;
	"

Nested STATEMENTS are not allowed in this first version of the language.
