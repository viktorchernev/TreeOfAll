v 0.1 - Initial test draft - The gold parser engine have been chosen for the task and some initial grammar drafted

Bugs:
#1: "literal/id": When there is a literal that is 8 symbols long it is mistaken for an id, resulting in a syntax error.
#2: "globalization": Cyrilic symbols result in a lexical error.
#3: "’" symbol produces an error

Done:

Todo:

Change grammar so no escape seqiences are needed for a forward slash "\/", commas "\," and such in literals
Add links to "item"s - "item ::= literal* links* tag"
