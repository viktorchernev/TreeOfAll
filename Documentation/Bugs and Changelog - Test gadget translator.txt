v 5 - Winforms. Implemented a propper parser for the #Describe language, instead of just dummy parsing

Bugs:
#1: escape backslashes are being displayed to the user.
#2: The translator enters an infinite loop if "ParseTextFiles" is called on non-existing file

Done:
The rudimentary idea of a special file containing all the sources/refferences has become obsolete with the concept of project files, thus file 0_source has been deleted.
Fix #2

Todo:
Find better way to figure out starting productions. Initially, every scripture file was intended to be part of one big tree - the tree of all, and thus, it made sense to have one root node tagged "rootnode" as a start. But since different files will be viewed now, and we don't want to have a single "rootnode" in every file, figuring out which productions to start as root(s) when building the visual tree is a chalange, at least in the way things are done. A workaround has been implemented where start productions are the ones that are not in any production left side, but this is slow and will give incorect visualization in case of recursion
Remove the functionality to draw winforms treeview from the test gadget and implement it in the test app
Do some initial refactoring
Add proper nullable and exception handling
