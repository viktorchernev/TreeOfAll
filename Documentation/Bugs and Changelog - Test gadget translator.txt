v 5 - Winforms. Implemented a propper parser for the #Describe language, instead of just dummy parsing

Bugs:
#1: escape backslashes are being displayed to the user.
#2: The translator enters an infinite loop if "ParseTextFiles" is called on non-existing file

Done:
The rudimentary idea of a special file containing all the sources/refferences has become obsolete with the concept of project files, thus file 0_source has been deleted.
Fix #2

Todo:
Fix the "escape sequence-visible backslashes" bug
Remove the functionality to draw winforms treeview from the test gadget and implement it in the test app
Do some initial refactoring
Add proper nullable and exception handling
